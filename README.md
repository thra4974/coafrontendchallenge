# coafrontendchallenge
Front End coding Challenge for entry level web development - City of Austin 
This is my first Github Repository
The CoA coding challenge was my first coding challenge. 
I mostly utilized Bootstrap, CSS3, and HTML5 since I am unfamiliar with React, however I believe I could pick up the technology relatively quickly. 
It wwas a good experience and motivated me to continue to learn frontend development.
